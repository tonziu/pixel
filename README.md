# What is Pixel
This project was born because I saw Raylib (see https://www.raylib.com/) and thought it was so much fun.

Pixel is just a fun way for me to replicate a similar graphics engine and learn about graphics programming. It is meant to become a small engine that can render shapes, images, text and other stuff that you can use to build a small 2D game.

Please consider that this is a personal project, it may be far from good.

## What it does
Here is a list of features currently supported:
- Basic FPS locking (not very accurate but it serves its purpose for now)
- Basic text rendering (default font, scaling, colour)
