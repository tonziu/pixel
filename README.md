# What is Pixel
This project was born because I saw Raylib (see https://www.raylib.com/) and thought it was so much fun.

Pixel is just a fun way for me to replicate a similar graphics engine and learn about graphics programming. It is meant to become a small engine that can render shapes, images, text and other stuff that you can use to build a small 2D game.

Please consider that this is a personal project, it may be far from good.
